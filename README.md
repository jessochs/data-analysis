# Overview

In this project, I used two different datasets from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). One has data about popular songs from the last few decades, and the other set is a student spending survey. 

I wrote this software to become more familiar with pandas in Python. Software and data go hand-in-hand, so I thought it would be important to learn how to use the two together.

# Data Analysis Results

## First Dataset

1. What is the average sale per song?
The average sale is 8.15. The data doesn't list and units of measurement, so it's hard to how much that really is.

2. What is the median sale?
The median sale is 6.438

3. What are the top songs in the dataset (most popular)?
I filtered the results to only the top 25, but the top three songs are Cherish, Angel, and Butterfly. Some songs were considered hits in mulltiple years, so that is how the most popular was determined.

4. Which artist has to most hit songs in the set?
Once again I filtered these results to only the top 10, but Madonna is number one.

5. What are the songs by the number one artist?
Since Madonna was found out to be top artist in the last result, I wanted to see all 48 songs that were listed. I wont name all but Vogue and Music made the list.

## Second Dataset

1. What is the average monthly income?
The average income is $1020.65/month

2. What is the average monthly rent cost?
The average rent charge is $696.01/month

3. What majors were included in this study?
This study only included science-based majors: biology, economics, computer science engineering, and psychology.

4. What is the overall trend of the data taken?
From this data we learned that 1000 student were interviewed, the mean, median, standard deviation, first and third quartiles of their monthly expenses, and the minimum/maximum in each category.

# Development Environment

For this project I used Kaggle.com, which is linked above, as well as YouTube and W3Shools for additional understand of the concepts.

This project was written in the Python language using the pandas library.
